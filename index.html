                <h4>2022</h4>
                <p>A study of programming languages, including their syntax, semantics, and implementation. 
                   Several different models of languages are discussed, including dynamic, scripting (e.g., Ruby, Python) 
                   functional (e.g., OCaml, Haskell, Scheme), and memory safe systems programming (e.g., Rust). 
                   Explores language features such as formal syntax, scoping and binding of variables, higher-order programming, 
                   typing, and type polymorphism. Introduces finite automata, context free grammar, parsing, lambda calculus, 
                   and basics of security attacks and software security.</p>
